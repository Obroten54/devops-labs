## Research Software Distribution Strategies

Software distribution involves delivering software applications or updates to end-users. It is essential for companies to effectively distribute their software to users as it serves as their primary source of revenue. There are various types of distribution methods:

- Package managers: Primarily utilized by developers during software development to manage dependencies and package installations.
- Cloud-based deployment: This refers to deploying software as a service in a cloud environment, allowing resources to be shared among users.
- Physical media distribution (considered outdated): This method entails purchasing CDs or DVDs and installing the software onto a local machine.
- Online downloads from websites: Users can download executable files from the official website of the application.
- App stores: These are specialized applications, primarily for mobile devices, where users can purchase or download various applications.

To ensure the delivery of high-quality software to users, it is important to follow these best practices:

- Version control: Maintain control over software versions and track changes effectively.
- Release management: Plan and execute software releases in a systematic manner.
- Clear documentation and 24/7 support: Provide comprehensive documentation and round-the-clock support for users.
- Automation and CI/CD with frequent changes: Employ automation and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes to facilitate frequent software updates.
- Analyze user feedback: Gather and analyze feedback from users to improve the software.
- High security: Implement robust security measures to protect the software and user data.
