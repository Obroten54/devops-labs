## Docker

**Tool name and description**: Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers.

**Purpose and benefits in the DevOps context**: Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications by providing a consistent environment across different systems. It promotes collaboration between developers and operations teams, streamlines the deployment process, and improves scalability and resource utilization.

**Key features and functionalities**: Docker allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a container, which can be easily distributed and deployed across different environments. It provides efficient resource isolation, allowing multiple containers to run on a single host without conflicts. Docker also offers a vast ecosystem of pre-built images and tools, simplifying the setup and configuration of software stacks.

**Use cases and examples**: Docker is used for application deployment and scaling, enabling developers to package their applications once and run them consistently in different environments. Docker is also used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), where it ensures that the software can be reliably built, tested, and deployed across various stages of the development lifecycle.
